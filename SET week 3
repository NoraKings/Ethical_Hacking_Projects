Used the SET tool kit, selected a web attack vector, cloned a website, entered the IP address and URL of the website to clone. A listener is up in the terminal waiting to capture any login details. 
The difference between the real website and clonesite is that the real one has a domain name and the fake has an ip address. So things to watch out for: 
-	It’s an ip instead of a domain name
-	A domain name with some minor redflags
-	If it’s a http site when we are used to an https it’s a concern
-	A different domain name with the same page
After the user logs in, it harvests credentials and redirects to the real webpage.
