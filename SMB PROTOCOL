SMB Protocol:
A protocol that helps devices within that network to share sensitive files and also helps Linux devices connect to Windows seamlessly. 
Attackers exploit this protocol to capture sensitive files, and we can use this command to inject a payload onto target devices. 
We used enum4linux for initial reconnaissance to see file shares available:
Enum4linux -a <target_machine_ip> to use all options at once, like -P for password policy, -U for users, and – sN for what services, ports,  and IPs are running. 
Used smbclient to access the file share
	Smbclient //172.17.0.2/print$ (couldn’t access share because the $doesn’t allow to see details)
	Smbclient //172.17.0.2/tmp (access share you would note the smb \> shows logged in)
	Put virus.exe groupwork.txt (used put and masked an exe file to load malware to the target machine).
