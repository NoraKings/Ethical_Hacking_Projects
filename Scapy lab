Scapy Lab Practical: 
- I learned how to view all available protocols using ls();
- filter ls() e.g. ls(IP) - to filter only commands for IP;
- packet sniffing using - sniff();
- used ping -c 4 <address> [to set ping count to 4]
- assigned sniff output to a file using [paro=_] and viewed output summary [paro.summary()]
- sniffed an interface using [sniff(iface="br-internal", filter="icmp", count=10) to filter for icmp and set count for sniff capture]
