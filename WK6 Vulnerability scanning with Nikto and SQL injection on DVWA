Vulnerability Scanning Tools 
Nikto: supports HTTP and https scanning. It is an active reconnaissance, so do not use it on platforms you do not have legal permission to scan. 
Used sites meant for practice purposes, such as scanme.com
	Nikto -h scanme.nmap.org
That code lists vulnerabilities found on the website. 
Went to “invicti.com/web-vulnerabiltiy-scanner/missing-content-type-header” to find out more about the vulnerability discovered. 
One of the vulnerabilities we found – a missing content type header shows that the browser would not know the content type and would accept any so malicious code can be sent undiscovered by browser. 
	nikto -h https://nmap.org -ssl
We can list several websites in a text file and add the text file to Nikto to scan all websites and give the report. 

To create the text file: 
	nano ip_list.txt   (opens a text file on terminal), <ctrl O> to save and <ctrl x> to close 
	nikto -h ip_list.txt  (nikto scans all sites on file)
	nikto -h 172.17.0.2   -o  scan_results.html (saves scan to a html file in an ordered manner)
Notes: When we find these vulnerabilities, we go to sites like invicti.com to find out more about them, how a threat actor can exploit them, and what we do to mitigate such vulnerabilities. 
Nikto also sends massive requests to the servers of the sites scanned, so organisations with IDS/IPS can capture the footprints, or web-app firewalls can capture those actions too. 
So, an organization would know active reconnaissance is being carried out on it, which is a note to take caution and level up their security too. 

SQL injection on DVWA
login with details: username: admin pw: password
set security level to low, medium, high, or impossible, and try sql injection.
